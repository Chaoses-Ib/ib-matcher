# We want to document all features.
all-features = true
# Since this crate's feature setup is pretty complicated, it is worth opting
# into a nightly unstable option to show the features that need to be enabled
# for public API items. To do that, we set 'docsrs', and when that's enabled,
# we enable the 'doc_auto_cfg' feature.
#
# To test this locally, run:
# ```
# RUSTDOCFLAGS="--cfg docsrs" cargo +nightly doc --all-features
# $env:RUSTDOCFLAGS="--cfg docsrs"; cargo +nightly doc --all-features
# ```
