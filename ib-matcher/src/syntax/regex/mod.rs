/*!
The syntax supported in this module is documented below. (Same as the [`regex`](https://docs.rs/regex/) crate.)

See [`ib_matcher::regex`](crate::regex) for regex engines.

Note that the regular expression parser and abstract syntax are exposed in
a separate crate, [`regex-syntax`](https://docs.rs/regex-syntax).

### Matching one character

<pre class="rust">
.             any character except new line (includes new line with s flag)
[0-9]         any ASCII digit
\d            digit (\p{Nd})
\D            not digit
\pX           Unicode character class identified by a one-letter name
\p{Greek}     Unicode character class (general category or script)
\PX           Negated Unicode character class identified by a one-letter name
\P{Greek}     negated Unicode character class (general category or script)
</pre>

### Character classes

<pre class="rust">
[xyz]         A character class matching either x, y or z (union).
[^xyz]        A character class matching any character except x, y and z.
[a-z]         A character class matching any character in range a-z.
[[:alpha:]]   ASCII character class ([A-Za-z])
[[:^alpha:]]  Negated ASCII character class ([^A-Za-z])
[x[^xyz]]     Nested/grouping character class (matching any character except y and z)
[a-y&&xyz]    Intersection (matching x or y)
[0-9&&[^4]]   Subtraction using intersection and negation (matching 0-9 except 4)
[0-9--4]      Direct subtraction (matching 0-9 except 4)
[a-g~~b-h]    Symmetric difference (matching `a` and `h` only)
[\[\]]        Escaping in character classes (matching [ or ])
[a&&b]        An empty character class matching nothing
</pre>

Any named character class may appear inside a bracketed `[...]` character
class. For example, `[\p{Greek}[:digit:]]` matches any ASCII digit or any
codepoint in the `Greek` script. `[\p{Greek}&&\pL]` matches Greek letters.

<div class="warning">

Escaping:
- `\` can escape the following metacharacter (but cannot escape a normal character).
- `[]]` is valid and matches `]`, but `[[]` is invalid and will cause `unclosed character class` error (because classes are allowed to nest).
- `[-]`, `[a-]` and `[-a]` are valid and can match `-`.
- `[a^]` is valid and can match `^`, but `[^]` is not.
- All other metacharacters are matched literally in `[]`, including `.`, `*`, `|` and `()`.
</div>

Precedence in character classes, from most binding to least:

1. Ranges: `[a-cd]` == `[[a-c]d]`
2. Union: `[ab&&bc]` == `[[ab]&&[bc]]`
3. Intersection, difference, symmetric difference. All three have equivalent
precedence, and are evaluated in left-to-right order. For example,
`[\pL--\p{Greek}&&\p{Uppercase}]` == `[[\pL--\p{Greek}]&&\p{Uppercase}]`.
4. Negation: `[^a-z&&b]` == `[^[a-z&&b]]`.

### Composites

<pre class="rust">
xy    concatenation (x followed by y)
x|y   alternation (x or y, prefer x)
</pre>

This example shows how an alternation works, and what it means to prefer a
branch in the alternation over subsequent branches.

```
use ib_matcher::regex::{cp::Regex, Match};

let haystack = "samwise";
// If 'samwise' comes first in our alternation, then it is
// preferred as a match, even if the regex engine could
// technically detect that 'sam' led to a match earlier.
let re = Regex::new(r"samwise|sam").unwrap();
assert_eq!(re.find(haystack).unwrap(), Match::must(0, 0..7)); // "samwise"
// But if 'sam' comes first, then it will match instead.
// In this case, it is impossible for 'samwise' to match
// because 'sam' is a prefix of it.
let re = Regex::new(r"sam|samwise").unwrap();
assert_eq!(re.find(haystack).unwrap(), Match::must(0, 0..3)); // "sam"
```

### Repetitions

<pre class="rust">
x*        zero or more of x (greedy)
x+        one or more of x (greedy)
x?        zero or one of x (greedy)
x*?       zero or more of x (ungreedy/lazy)
x+?       one or more of x (ungreedy/lazy)
x??       zero or one of x (ungreedy/lazy)
x{n,m}    at least n x and at most m x (greedy)
x{n,}     at least n x (greedy)
x{n}      exactly n x
x{n,m}?   at least n x and at most m x (ungreedy/lazy)
x{n,}?    at least n x (ungreedy/lazy)
x{n}?     exactly n x
</pre>

### Empty matches

<pre class="rust">
^               the beginning of a haystack (or start-of-line with multi-line mode)
$               the end of a haystack (or end-of-line with multi-line mode)
\A              only the beginning of a haystack (even with multi-line mode enabled)
\z              only the end of a haystack (even with multi-line mode enabled)
\b              a Unicode word boundary (\w on one side and \W, \A, or \z on other)
\B              not a Unicode word boundary
\b{start}, \<   a Unicode start-of-word boundary (\W|\A on the left, \w on the right)
\b{end}, \>     a Unicode end-of-word boundary (\w on the left, \W|\z on the right))
\b{start-half}  half of a Unicode start-of-word boundary (\W|\A on the left)
\b{end-half}    half of a Unicode end-of-word boundary (\W|\z on the right)
</pre>

The empty regex is valid and matches the empty string. For example, the
empty regex matches `abc` at positions `0`, `1`, `2` and `3`. When using the
top-level [`cp::Regex`] on `&str` haystacks, an empty match that splits a codepoint
is guaranteed to never be returned. For example:

```rust
use ib_matcher::regex;

let re = regex::cp::Regex::new(r"").unwrap();
let ranges: Vec<_> = re.find_iter("💩").map(|m| m.range()).collect();
assert_eq!(ranges, vec![0..0, 4..4]);
```

Note that an empty regex is distinct from a regex that can never match.
For example, the regex `[a&&b]` is a character class that represents the
intersection of `a` and `b`. That intersection is empty, which means the
character class is empty. Since nothing is in the empty set, `[a&&b]` matches
nothing, not even the empty string.

### Grouping and flags

<pre class="rust">
(exp)          numbered capture group (indexed by opening parenthesis)
(?P&lt;name&gt;exp)  named (also numbered) capture group (names must be alpha-numeric)
(?&lt;name&gt;exp)   named (also numbered) capture group (names must be alpha-numeric)
(?:exp)        non-capturing group
(?flags)       set flags within current group
(?flags:exp)   set flags for exp (non-capturing)
</pre>

Capture group names must be any sequence of alpha-numeric Unicode codepoints,
in addition to `.`, `_`, `[` and `]`. Names must start with either an `_` or
an alphabetic codepoint. Alphabetic codepoints correspond to the `Alphabetic`
Unicode property, while numeric codepoints correspond to the union of the
`Decimal_Number`, `Letter_Number` and `Other_Number` general categories.

Flags are each a single character. For example, `(?x)` sets the flag `x`
and `(?-x)` clears the flag `x`. Multiple flags can be set or cleared at
the same time: `(?xy)` sets both the `x` and `y` flags and `(?x-y)` sets
the `x` flag and clears the `y` flag.

All flags are by default disabled unless stated otherwise. They are:

<pre class="rust">
i     case-insensitive: letters match both upper and lower case
m     multi-line mode: ^ and $ match begin/end of line
s     allow . to match \n
R     enables CRLF mode: when multi-line mode is enabled, \r\n is used
U     swap the meaning of x* and x*?
u     Unicode support (enabled by default)
x     verbose mode, ignores whitespace and allow line comments (starting with `#`)
</pre>

Note that in verbose mode, whitespace is ignored everywhere, including within
character classes. To insert whitespace, use its escaped form or a hex literal.
For example, `\ ` or `\x20` for an ASCII space.

Flags can be toggled within a pattern. Here's an example that matches
case-insensitively for the first part but case-sensitively for the second part:

```rust
use ib_matcher::regex::{cp::Regex, Match};

let re = Regex::new(r"(?i)a+(?-i)b+").unwrap();
let m = re.find("AaAaAbbBBBb").unwrap();
assert_eq!(m, Match::must(0, 0..7)); // "AaAaAbb"
```

Notice that the `a+` matches either `a` or `A`, but the `b+` only matches
`b`.

Multi-line mode means `^` and `$` no longer match just at the beginning/end of
the input, but also at the beginning/end of lines:

```
use ib_matcher::regex::{cp::Regex, Match};

let re = Regex::new(r"(?m)^line \d+").unwrap();
let m = re.find("line one\nline 2\n").unwrap();
assert_eq!(m, Match::must(0, 9..15)); // "line 2"
```

Note that `^` matches after new lines, even at the end of input:

```
use ib_matcher::regex::cp::Regex;

let re = Regex::new(r"(?m)^").unwrap();
let m = re.find_iter("test\n").last().unwrap();
assert_eq!((m.start(), m.end()), (5, 5));
```

When both CRLF mode and multi-line mode are enabled, then `^` and `$` will
match either `\r` and `\n`, but never in the middle of a `\r\n`:

```
use ib_matcher::regex::{cp::Regex, Match};

let re = Regex::new(r"(?mR)^foo$").unwrap();
let m = re.find("\r\nfoo\r\n").unwrap();
assert_eq!(m, Match::must(0, 2..5)); // "foo"
```

Unicode mode can also be selectively disabled, although only when the result
*would not* match invalid UTF-8. One good example of this is using an ASCII
word boundary instead of a Unicode word boundary, which might make some regex
searches run faster:

```rust
use ib_matcher::regex::{cp::Regex, Match};

let re = Regex::new(r"(?-u:\b).+(?-u:\b)").unwrap();
let m = re.find("$$abc$$").unwrap();
assert_eq!(m, Match::must(0, 2..5)); // "abc"
```

### Escape sequences

documented elsewhere.

\*              literal *, applies to all ASCII except [0-9A-Za-z<>]

\t              horizontal tab
\n              new line
\r              carriage return
\v              vertical tab (\x0B)
\A              matches at the beginning of a haystack
\z              matches at the end of a haystack
\b              word boundary assertion
\B              negated word boundary assertion
\b{start}, \<   start-of-word boundary assertion
